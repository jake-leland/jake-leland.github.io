<!-- Intro Section -->
<section id="main" class="main section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="well">
            <h1 align="center">What</h1>
            <p>Hopefully, after looking through my project experience, you've able to get a sense of some of the things
                I'm most interested in. The past few years have been years of tremendous opportunity &ndash; both inside
                and outside of the classroom &ndash; and I've been able to dive deep into a lot of computer science
                specializations.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, the real significance is not in project deliverables, but in the intangible
                benefits &ndash; the knowledge, skills, and abilities. Learning must extend beyond the classroom.
                College serves as a great way to kick-start students into their careers, but it soon becomes apparent
                that collegiate knowledge mainly serves to get you in the door, and that learning has only begun.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="well">
            <h1 align="center">So What</h1>
            <p>In reality, my experiences so far have served to prepare me for the future. For example, while I may not
                be writing web applications for my job, the self-discipline, good practices, and collaboration skills
                will take me much further than the scope of the original project. Experiences matter, and I'm now a much
                more well-rounded person than I was a few years ago. Sure, I'm a better programmer, but I've picked up
                on competencies that would never have been my first thought, like the implications of cultural diversity
                and ethics, or the dynamics of unifying a team. These are the experiences that I will carry with me into
                the future.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="well">
            <h1 align="center">Now What</h1>
            <p>So ultimately, I have a way better understanding of my field than I could have ever anticipated, and it's
                not for the reasons I would have guessed. I've got some great technical experience, but I've found that
                some of the greatest values in school and/or work are often found outside of the suspected range of
                experiences. Like I mentioned before, I'm a better programmer, sure, but I've learned so much more than
                just the technical knowledge. It's not just limited to computer science; A&amp;M and my internships have
                provided me with a wealth of exposure across all kinds of disciplines, and as a result, I've gained a
                more broad, open perspective on life. In the end, these kinds of experiences have served to form some
                critical components of who I am and how I fit into society.
